**🧠 Store Module Documentation (store.js)**

The store.js file serves as the Data Access Layer for the Kanban application. It acts as the "Manager" of the browser's localStorage, ensuring that all task data is persistent, uniquely identified, and correctly formatted.

**FUNCTIONS EXPLAINATION:**

**1. getToday()**

   **Definition:** A utility function that standardizes the current system date.

    **The Logic:** It takes a new Date() object, converts it to an ISO string, and splits it at the "T" to extract
    only the YYYY-MM-DD portion.

    **Why it's used:** To ensure the application always opens to a consistent "Current Day" view and to provide a
    standardized date format for database filtering.


**2. getTasks(filterDate)**

  **Definition:** The primary "Read" function for the database.

    **The Logic:**

    **Retrieval:** It fetches the raw JSON string from localStorage using the STORAGE_KEY.

    **Parsing:** It converts that text back into a JavaScript Array using JSON.parse().

    **Filtering:** It uses the .filter() method to extract only the tasks where the task.date matches the filterDate
    provided.

    **Output:** Returns an array of task objects specifically for the selected day.


**3. saveTasks(allTasks)**

  **Definition:** An internal helper function responsible for the final "Write" to memory.

    **The Logic:** Since localStorage can only store strings, this function uses JSON.stringify(allTasks) to "vacuum-
    pack" the entire task array into a single text block.

    **The Action:** It overwrites the existing data in the STORAGE_KEY drawer with the new, updated string.


**4. addTask(content, date, priority)**

  **Definition:** The "Factory" function that creates new task entries.

  **Step-by-Step Logic:**

    **i) State Retrieval:** It grabs the current list of all tasks.

    **ii) Object Creation:** It builds a new object with:

            **id:** A unique timestamp generated by Date.now().
            
            **content:** The user's input text.
            
            **status:** Automatically set to 'todo'.
            
            **date:** The assigned calendar date.
            
            **priority:** The selected importance level (defaults to 'medium').

    **iii) Persistence:** It pushes the new task into the array and calls saveTasks() to make it permanent.


**5. updateTaskStatus(id, newStatus)**

  **Definition:** The "Mover" function that handles task transitions between columns.

  **Step-by-Step Logic:**

    **State Retrieval:** It accesses the central task array from localStorage.
    
    **Task Identification:** It searches the array for a specific task using the .find() method, ensuring the id is
    treated as a number for a perfect match.
    
    **Status Modification:** Once the correct task is located, it updates the status property to the newStatus
    (e.g., moving it from 'todo' to 'doing').
    
    **Persistence:** It calls saveTasks() to overwrite the old data with the updated status, ensuring the move is
    remembered after a page refresh.
